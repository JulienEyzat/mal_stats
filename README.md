# mal_stats

A scrapping program to get information (note and members) on seasonal animes on the site myanimelist.net.
Then, it puts the information in a google spreadsheet.

To have the program working, you need to go on this page :Â https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python and click on the button "ENABLE THE GOOGLE SHEET API". Then, you just need to put the file `credentials.json` in the `GS_resources` directory.
